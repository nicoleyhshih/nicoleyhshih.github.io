    <p>Phoenix has emerged as one of the top U.S. markets attracting investor attention in commercial real estate. Among all sectors, industrial properties in Phoenix led the way, topping the nation in sales volume over the past 12 months at $4.6 billion, according to CoStar data. Office ranked fifth in sales volume during the same period, while retail came in sixth. While high transaction activity signals strong market liquidity and sustained interest from buyers, Phoenix also benefits from robust job growth, population inflows and all other economic-based factors that drive the long-term investment appeal.</p>

    <p>Identifying investment-worthy submarkets involves analyzing key indicators: high annual rent growth, low vacancy rates, positive net absorption, and significant sales volume.</p>

    <h2>Industrial</h2>

    <p>Phoenix’s industrial sector has solidified its reputation as a national powerhouse. Notable submarkets include:</p>

    <h3>Chandler</h3>
    <p>Chandler exemplifies strong fundamentals with low vacancy rates, high positive net absorption, significant annual rent growth, and robust sales volumes. The ongoing construction activities, notably driven by Intel’s substantial presence, have transformed Chandler from a quiet agricultural town into a thriving technological hub known as the “Silicon Desert.”</p>

    <h3>Glendale</h3>
    <p>Glendale presents an interesting scenario with a seemingly high vacancy rate of 27% as of Q1 2025. However, this elevated vacancy largely results from extensive new construction driven by tenant demand. High positive net absorption (6.39 million square feet) and substantial sales volume indicate significant tenant interest and investor confidence. Major projects such as Virgin Industrial Park and VT 101 Industrial Park (initiated in June 2024) further underscore Glendale’s industrial attractiveness.</p>

    <h3>Goodyear</h3>
    <p>Similar to Glendale, Goodyear exhibits strong sales volume, considerable rent growth, and positive absorption, despite higher vacancies caused by extensive construction activity aimed at meeting growing tenant demands.</p>

    <p>Other promising submarkets include Tolleson, recognized for the highest annual rent growth, low vacancy, and positive absorption, and Tempe Northwest, which also shows notable economic health indicators.</p>

    <h2>Office</h2>

    <p>Phoenix’s office market maintains stable momentum, ranking fifth nationally in sales volume, following closely behind Washington D.C., Los Angeles, and Boston.</p>

    <h3>Arrowhead</h3>
    <p>Arrowhead has displayed resilience, with a 3.4% annual rent growth, low vacancy rate, and active office construction projects. Recent developments in medical office space significantly contribute to market dynamics. The Arrowhead Executive Center, undergoing major renovations, and the newly established 175,000-square-foot Phoenix Children's Hospital – Arrowhead Campus is expected to drive further demand for medical office space in the area.</p>

    <h3>Loop 303/Surprise & North I-17 Corridor</h3>
    <p>While currently showing modest sales volumes and ongoing construction (approximately 10,000 SF), these submarkets boast higher-than-average rent growth rates. The proximity to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) facility positions these areas for future expansion and investment activity.</p>

    <h3>Tempe</h3>
    <p>Tempe currently has high vacancy rates without ongoing construction, indicating a stabilization phase as the market absorbs existing vacant office space. Developers appear to be cautiously awaiting further vacancy reductions before initiating new projects.</p>

    <h3>Camelback Corridor</h3>
    <p>Despite its long-term prominence, Camelback Corridor faces short-term challenges. The submarket's older office inventory, negative annual rent growth (-0.2%), and minimal suitability for modern tenant preferences (hybrid work arrangements) signal opportunities for investors willing to engage in repositioning, redevelopment, or adaptive reuse strategies. Continued strong sales volume suggests investor confidence in long-term market recovery.</p>

    <h3>Midtown</h3>
    <p>Midtown experiences high vacancy rates, low rent growth, and negative net absorption, signaling a challenging transitional period with surplus office availability and declining tenant demand.</p>

    <h2>Retail</h2>

    <p>Phoenix’s retail market outperforms national benchmarks in rent growth, reporting 3.4% compared to the national average of 1.8%. Coupled with its prominent sales volume ranking, this highlights significant investor potential.</p>

    <p>Healthy retail markets typically exhibit vacancy rates below 6%. Most Phoenix submarkets meet this benchmark, with a few exceptions.</p>

    <h3>Surprise / North Peoria</h3>
    <p>The Surprise and North Peoria submarkets are experiencing rapid retail expansion, fueled by significant population growth and large-scale economic investments. Notably, the proximity to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) $165 billion investment in Phoenix has spurred demand for housing and retail, leading to low vacancy rates and high rent growth in these areas.</p>

    <p>A prime example of this growth is The Shops at Lake Pleasant in North Peoria, which spans nearly 90,000 square feet and is nearly 100% leased. Additionally, the Peoria Innovation Core is anticipated to generate up to $1.5 billion, directly benefiting the local economy and further enhancing the area's retail appeal.</p>

    <h3>Gilbert</h3>
    <p>Gilbert continues to be one of the strongest retail performers in the Phoenix metro area. The submarket has experienced robust rent growth, reaching an impressive 8.6%, and maintains a low vacancy rate of 4.9%. Significant sales volumes, including an $85.3 million transaction, underscore investor confidence in the area.</p>

    <p>New developments are also contributing to Gilbert's retail landscape. The Northside at SanTan Village, a mixed-use center, is bringing additional retail space to the market, catering to the growing demand from both consumers and retailers.</p>
